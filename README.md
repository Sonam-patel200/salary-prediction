# Salary Prediction
   - An end-to-end data science project I made as a machine learning intern @ Mentorness.
   - This project predicts employee salaries using advanced regression techniques and thorough data preprocessing. We compare multiple machine learning models to select the best-performing one, which is then integrated into a pipeline. This pipeline includes all necessary preprocessing steps, ensuring accurate predictions and easy deployment.
